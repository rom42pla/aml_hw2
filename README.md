# Homework 2

## Who are we?

## What do we had to do?
This homework was about Neural Networks (both a naive implementation of a 2-layer MLP and a PyTorch net), hyperparameters' tuning and performances evaluation.

Check the [text](https://github.com/rom42pla/aml_hw2/blob/main/text.pdf) for more infos.

## How to check our results?
Some questions that requires particular explanations are shown in a brief [report](https://github.com/rom42pla/aml_hw2/blob/main/report.pdf).

If you prefer to run the code on your device follow these steps instead:

- clone this repo to your device: `git clone https://github.com/rom42pla/aml_hw2.git; cd aml_hw2`
- if you don't have the `datasets` folder, download them with `bash get_datasets.sh`
- check the results of the various tasks: `python ex2_FCnet.py; python ex2_pytorch.py`

The latter will popup all the plots on screen and the standard output to the console.
